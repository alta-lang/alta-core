# AltaCore
Alta's core frontend functionality, wrapped into a neat, not-so-little library.

Very big and very important, since it contains Alta's lexer (Waterwheel), parser (Palo), abstract syntax tree (AST) implementation, detailed environment tree (DET) implementation, and module system.

## Changelog
See [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md) for changes.
